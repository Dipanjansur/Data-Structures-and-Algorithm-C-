- [UNIQUE vs DISTINCT](https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-unique-and-distinct-in-sql/#:~:text=%20Difference%20Between%20Unique%20and%20Distinct%20in%20SQL,stored%20in%20the%20database.%20Unique%20and...%20More%20) **: UNIQUE is used during CREATE TABLE query while DISTINCT is used during SELECT query. Unique ensures no value is repeated in the column (kind of an integrity constraint) whereas DISTINCT removes duplicate values and retrives only non repeating values during selection of entries.**
