- **My Interview Round 2:** Shyam loves reading books. He is reading a book with N chapters. He wants to complete the book in K days.
You need to help him decide how many pages he should read each day so that the total number of pages read by him on any day is minimized. 

Constraints:
A chapter if started needs to be completed on the same day.
He can only read the book from cover to cover and cannot skip any page/chapter.


Example 1
Number of pages in chapters = {8, 5, 6, 12}
Number of days = 3

        Day 1:  Chapter 1. (8)
        Day 2:  Chapters 2 and 3. (11) 
        Day 2:  Chapter 4 (12)


Example 2
Number of Days to Finish book = 3
Number of pages in chapters = {10, 5, 6}

     Day 1:  Chapter 1
     Day 2:  Chapters 2 and 3
     
     
- **My Interview Round 2:** Shyam is in love with a spreadsheet and he was to implement a sheet with size MxN with three functionality

1. Update a cell value with an Integer value or expression**
2. Read the cell value
3. Print entire spreadsheet


the expression can be defined as a combination of different cell and mathematical operator like (+/-/*)

*Example:* M=4, N=5

- updateSheet(E,3,”10”)

- updateSheet(C,3,”100”)

- updateSheet(D,2,”E3+5”)

- readSheet(D,2)==> 15

- updateSheet(B,2,”C3+10”)

- readSheet(B,2)==> 110

- printSheet()
